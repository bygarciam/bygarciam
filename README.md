<h2>Hi, I’m Oscar García 👋</h2>

<p>
I’m in the final stage of my Computer Systems Engineering degree and transitioning into <b>Cloud Security Engineering</b>.
</p>

<p>
I previously worked in <b>IT/Technical Support (Automotive)</b>, assisting with basic troubleshooting (Windows/network/connectivity),
documenting issues, and escalating cases while supporting infrastructure tasks under supervision.
</p>

<p>
I’m seeking <b>entry-level / internship</b> opportunities as a <b>Cloud Security Engineer</b>, focused on <b>banking & financial security</b>,
and open to other regulated industries.
</p>

<p>
Currently: <b>AZ-900</b> (in progress) + <b>IBM Cybersecurity Analyst</b>. I’m building a portfolio with <b>Python security tooling</b> and
<b>AI-assisted security triage</b>.
